Hello, I am an undergraduate student at Ewha Womans University. My current research interest is the **evaluation of LLMs**, with a particular focus on **hallucination detection**. I am also interested in developing practical AI applications using NLP technologies such as **agents** and **RAG**.

If you have any questions about me or want to collaborate with me, please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:judyjoo21@ewha.ac.kr) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minsuh-joo-b77a30377/).
